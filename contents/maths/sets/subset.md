# Subset



## All subsets of a set

Given, `A = {1,2,3,4}`

All the subsets of set A are:

``` 
{} (the empty set, also denote as Φ)

{1}, {2}, {3}, {4},

{1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3},{2,4}, {3,4},

{1,2,3}, {2,3,4}, {1,3,4}, {1,2,4}

{1,2,3,4}
```



Some important properties of subsets are: 

- If a set has “n” elements, then the number of subset is $2^n$
- An empty set, `Φ`, is a subset of any given set.
- Given a set, it is considered a subset of itself.
  - This is a special subset and we called it **improper subset**, and it has a special notation: `{1,2,3,4} ⊆ {1,2,3,4}`.



## Types of Subsets

There are two kinds of subsets: 

- proper subset
- Improper subsets

#### Proper subset (WIP)

​	if a set contains `n` elements, then 



## Some confusion on the $ \subset $ symbol:

Given a set  $ A =\{1,2,3\} $​ ,  we consider $ \{1,2,3\} $​ a subset of $A$​.  

We do not write

$$ \{1,2,3\} \subset A $$​ 

because the symbol $ \subset $​ is used to denote **proper** subset.  

When we write 

$$ A \subset B $$​

it reads $A$​ is a proper subset of $B$​,  which implies 

$$A \neq B$$​  

Given two sets A and B, where $A =\{1,2,3\}$  and  $B =\{1,2,3\}$,  since $A = B$  and that identical set are subset of each other,  we say $A$ is an **improper** subset of $B$  and we write:

$$\{1,2,3\} \subseteq B $$​.

or 

$$A \subseteq B $$
