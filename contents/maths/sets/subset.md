# Subset



## Improper and proper subset 

Given a set $A = \lbrace 1,2,3,4 \rbrace$, and let us say $B$ be a set that is a subset of $A$, then the following listed all posible $B$: 

``` 
{} (the empty set, also denote as Φ)

{1}, {2}, {3}, {4},

{1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3},{2,4}, {3,4},

{1,2,3}, {2,3,4}, {1,3,4}, {1,2,4}

{1,2,3,4}
```

We often use the **improper subset** notation, $\subseteq$, to denote all possible subset of a set: 
$$
B \subseteq A
$$

The above is read $B$ is an improper subset of set $A$ . 

We notice that there is one set among the improper subset of set $A$ whose number of elements "n" equal the number of element of $A$.  In fact this set is identical to $A$ itself: 
$$
B = A
$$
All other sets where $B \neq A$ is called the **proper subset**, and can be denote with the $\subset$ notation: 
$$
B \subset A
$$


The above is read *B is an proper subset of A*				
					

If a set has “n” elements, then the number of improper subset is $2^n$ (proof?).  So there are $2^n$ - 1 proper subset.
