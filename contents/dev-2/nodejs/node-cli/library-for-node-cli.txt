What library should I use for creating a CLI?

https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs
https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander

https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk
https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston

https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/

https://github.com/mattallty/Caporal.js


------
"When you are done with your CLI app and you want to distribute
it, you can use the "pkg" node module:

  https://github.com/vercel/pkg

to package your code, its dependencies, and node itself into individual
binary executables for linux/mac/windows!"

(not sure how is pkg different from ncc)
