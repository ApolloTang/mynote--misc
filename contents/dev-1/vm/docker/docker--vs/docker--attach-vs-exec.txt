docker attach
==============

  In term1 create a container based on the busybox image:

    $ docker run -it busybox sh

  with the above, your terminal prompt is replaced by the container
  shell's prompt.

  If you type "exist" you will stop container and get
  your original terminal prompt back.

  Now create another instant of busybox instant again. This time
  instead of typeing "exist", use the container's key sequence:

    CTRL-p CTRL-q.

  You can get your original terminal prompt back, but the container
  is not stop, it is running in the background.

  To reattach your container use "docker ps" to get your running
  container id, and type:

    $ docker attach <container id>

  Note that the above is different from "docker exec". To illustrate
  this, in another terminal (term2) do:

    $ docker exec -it <container id> sh

  This will create a new sh process in your running container.
  If you "exit" this sh process, your container will not stop;
  you simply stop the new sh process.
