## About the command palette

Both `Ctrl + P` and `Ctrl + Shift + P`  ( Mac: `CMD + P` and `CMD + Shift + P`) openeing the command palette. The different is  `Ctrl + Shift + P` opens it with a ">" pre-filled, which give you the VS Code Feature Access.  In `CMD + P` you have to type ">" manual to get the VS Code Feature Access.  

Without the ">" you don't have VS Code Feature Access, but allow you to to quickly search and jump to any file within your current project, saving you the hassle of manually browsing through the explorer.
