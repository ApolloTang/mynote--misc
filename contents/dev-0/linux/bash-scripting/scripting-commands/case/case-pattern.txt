pattern in case:
----------------

Brace expansion doesn't work, but *, ? and [] do.

see:
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html#Pattern-Matching


If you set shopt
 -s extglob then you can also use extended pattern matching:

?() - zero or one occurrences of pattern
*() - zero or more occurrences of pattern
+() - one or more occurrences of pattern
@() - one occurrence of pattern
!() - anything except the pattern
