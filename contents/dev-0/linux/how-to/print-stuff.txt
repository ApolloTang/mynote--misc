Get first line of a shell command's output
------------------------------------------

  vim --version | head -n 1

  vim --version | sed 1q         (quit after first line)
  vim --version | sed -n 1p      (only print first line, but read everything)

  vim --version | awk 'FNR == 1' (only print first line, but read everything)

 If the command outputs anything to standard error that you would
 like to capture in the same manner, you need to redirect the
 standard error of the command to the standard output stream:

  vim --vesrion 2>&1 | head -n 1
