 - Linux is case-sensitive

 - Windows has a case-insensitive file system.
 - By default, Mac uses a case-insensitive file system.

However, if you do the following on linux:

 git config --global core.ignorecase true

Git will make git case-sensitive to filename and see them as two separate entries.
When you check out the repo on window or Mac, the separate file will merged silently.
