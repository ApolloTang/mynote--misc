An expression is a **value**, or anything that executes and ends up being a **value**. is composed of variables, operators, function calls, and literals.



A **statement** is a group of expressions or statements. 

Statements either return a value or don’t return a value. If returns a value then it can be used as an expression. [That is why a function or class is a statement and also an expression in JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/statement-vs-expression-whats-the-difference-in-programming/)

In programming, an **expression** is any word or group of words or symbols that is a value. In programming, an expression is a value, or anything that executes and ends up being a value. It is necessary to understand that a value is unique. [For example, const, let, 2, 4, s, a, true, false, and world are values because each of them is unique in meaning or character](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/statement-vs-expression-whats-the-difference-in-programming/)[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/statement-vs-expression-whats-the-difference-in-programming/).

A **statement** is a group of expressions and/or statements that you design to carry out a task or an action. Statements are two-sided – that is, they either do tasks or don’t do them. Any statement that can return a value is automatically qualified to be used as an expression.
