## file system

**Data Item**

The basic component of a ﬁle in a ﬁle system is a **data item**, which is the smallest named unit of data that has meaning.

**Example**, last name, ﬁrst name, street address, ID number, or political party. 



**Record**

A group of **related data** items treated as a single unit by an application is called a **record**. 

**Examples** of types of records are order, salesperson, customer, product, and department. 



**File**

A **ﬁle** is a collection of records of a **single type**  (meaning: single kind (type) of record). 



## database system

**Database systems** have built upon and expanded deﬁnitions of File.

In a relational database, a data item is called a column or attribute; a record is called a row or tuple; and a ﬁle is called a table:

| File system | database              |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| data item   | column (or attribute) |
| record      | row (or tuple)        |
| file        | table                 |

A database is an interrelated collections of many different types of tables
