readlink -f does two things [1]:

  1. It iterates along a sequence of symlinks until it finds an actual file.
  2. It returns that file's canonicalized nameâ€”i.e., its absolute pathname.

What is the usage?

  It is often use to get shell-script's absolute path [2]

    echo "$(greadlink -f $0)"               # [2][5]
    echo "$(greadlink -f "$BASH_SOURCE")"   # [4][5]

Problem:

  it is not portable [1][2][4]
  it only work with one file [3].
