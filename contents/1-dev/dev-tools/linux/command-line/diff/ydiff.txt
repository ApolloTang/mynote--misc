"ydiff" gives you side-by-side diff in a terminal:

To install:

  brew install ydiff

To use:

  diff -ur dir1 dir2 | ydiff -w 0 -s

Note: 

  The -u flag tells the "diff" command line numbers.
  The -s flag tells the "ydiff" command to display side-by-side

Can also use together with git:

  git diff --no-ext-diff | ydiff -w 0 -s

or

  gdf | ydiff -w 0 -s 

since I have alias "gdf" to "git diff --no-ext-diff"
