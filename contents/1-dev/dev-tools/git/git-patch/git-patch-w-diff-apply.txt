Creating and Applying patch
===========================

  reference [1][2]
  Creating a patch is same as generating diff
  ...........................................

    $ gdf 3572303..e5445d5 > changed-3572303-to-e5445d5.patch

      where alias gdf='git diff --no-ext-diff'


  Applying patch
  ..............

    Make sure that the branch you have checked out is the one that
    you want to apply the patch to. Use the command 'apply'
    to apply the patch:

    $ git apply changed-3572303-to-e5445d5.patch


  If the patch is not 'apply-able' you can force it with --3way [3]

  Note that if the files involve in patching is binary, you have
  to create the patch with --binary [2][4]
