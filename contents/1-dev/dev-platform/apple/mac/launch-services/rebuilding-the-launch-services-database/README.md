# Rebuilding the Launch Services database

## What is Open with launch menu

This is the **launch menu**, it is opened when you right click and items in finder:

![open-w-menui](./assets/open-w-menu.jpg)

## What could go wrong with open with menu?

Symptoms of a launch service database that hasn’t been rebuilt in a long time:

- apps that appear in the **Open With** menu that aren’t usable. 
- it takes your Mac an unusually long time to generate the list. 
- apps in the list that were deleted from your Mac long ago.

## How to rebuild open with menu?

I know two way of rebuild launch service database:

1. **lsregister:** command for LaunchServices
2. free **[OnyX](https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/index.html) utility** from Titanium Software
