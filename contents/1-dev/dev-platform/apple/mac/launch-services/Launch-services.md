# Launch services



## What is macOS's Launch Services?

- **Launch Services** manages default app bindings on macOS.
- It uses a **database/cache** to store app-document associations, which is updated automatically or via tools like `lsregister`.
- The **com.apple.LaunchServices.plist** file is a preferences file related to Launch Services but should not be edited directly.
- Default app changes are best made using the **`defaults write`** command or Launch Services API, followed by refreshing the Launch Services database.
- Tools like **`lsregister`** help rebuild or clean the Launch Services database to resolve issues.
