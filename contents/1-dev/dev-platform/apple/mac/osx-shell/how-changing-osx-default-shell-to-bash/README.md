# How to change osx default shell to Bash

The Bash came with OSX located at `/bin/bash` is broken, you have install bash via Brew. 

Brew's  installation of Bash is located at: 

```zsh
$ brew --prefix bash
/opt/homebrew/opt/bash
```

With new Bash install you can change the default shell using the command: 

```zsh
$ chsh -s /opt/homebrew/opt/bash
```

For the above to  work you have to add `/opt/homebrew/opt/bash` to the file `/etc/shells`; this is because `chsh` will only accept a shell listed in that file . 

However, we cannot edit the file `/etc/shells`.  How to get arround?  There is the trick to add item to `/etc/shells` that I found from: [Unable to modify /etc/shells on macOS to include brew installed version of bash - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49048720/unable-to-modify-etc-shells-on-macos-to-include-brew-installed-version-of-bash/52554474#52554474) : 

```bash
$ sudo sh -c "echo $(which bash) >> /etc/shells"  # Trick to add a item. 
$ chsh -s $(which bash)
```

In the above `$(which bash)` expands to `/opt/homebrew/opt/bash` because I have already added `/opt/homebrew/opt/bash` to my PATH environment variable.

Details see:  [Changing default shell from zsh to bash on MacOS (Catalina and beyond) - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77052638/changing-default-shell-from-zsh-to-bash-on-macos-catalina-and-beyond) 


Another way to change shell is use `ï£¿ > System Settings > Users & Groups`. **Control-click** your user name or user picture in the list of users on the right to reveal **Advanced Options**. However this method does not work because you cannot navigate to `/opt/homebrew/opt/bash`  as `/opt`is a hidden direactory.
