Using od
--------

    If you want to see \r and \n as it is, use the octal dump command
    in terminal:

        od -c <file-name>


Using cat
---------

  By using cat and -A you can see new lines as $ and tabs as ^I:

    cat -A myfile

  However, 'cat -A' is not as portable as 'cat -e'. -A is supported by GNU coreutils version of cat(1), but not other implementations (e.g., bsd, macos, etc.).
