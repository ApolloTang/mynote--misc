::: FTP and line ending

    All FTP software can transfer files in "ascii" or "binary" mode.

    In "ascii" mode, the FTP software will convert line breaks, in "binary"
    mode it will not.  In "ascii" mode, transferring a Windows file from a
    Windows PC to a Linux server results in a UNIX file on the server.

    Downloading the file again converts it back to Windows.  Many FTP clients
    also have an "automatic" mode that switches between ascii and binary
    depending on the extension of the file you're transferring.

    Watch out when upload file as binary mode:

        When a webmaster uploads a Windows file to a Linux server in "binary"
        mode, the file has CR LF line breaks on the server. If you then
        download that file with your web browser on your Windows PC (which does
        the UNIX->Windows conversion), the browser will interpret the
        downloaded file as a UNIX file, even though it is in Windows format. It
        will convert each LF into CR LF, resulting in a file that uses CR CR LF
        as line breaks.

        So, before uploading a file, use the Convert menu to make sure the file
        has the line break style that the server expects (if the server cares
        at all).
