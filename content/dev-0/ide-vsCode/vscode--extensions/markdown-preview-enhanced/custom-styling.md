# How to customize *markdown-preview-enhanced* extension

The stylesheet for **markdown-preview-enhanced extension** is: 

```
~/.mume/style.less
```

To open this file in VScode, use: `[cmd-sft-p]`, then type `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Customize Css`.

For my setup the file `~/.mume/style.less` is symlinked to a git version control located at: 

```
~/1/1-sy/configurations/vscode/vscode-setting/markdown-preview-enhanced/style.less
```
To aid customization you can open the inspector from the VScode's dropdown menu:

```
help > Toggle developer tool [opt-cmd-i]
```
To refresh view, use: `[cmd-sft-p]` then type: `Developer: Reload Window`
