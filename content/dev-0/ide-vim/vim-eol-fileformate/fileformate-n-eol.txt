ff = fileformat

One thing you should keep in mind to understand ff:

    \r and \n is never display as it is in vim.  The display of \r
    and \n is always interpreted depends on the value of ff, combind
    with the value of eol specified in lcs.

    If you want to see \r and \n as it is, use the octal dump command
    in terminal:

        od -c <file-name>

• Value of ff is set on per buffer bases.
• Vim write and display the eol charecters according to value of ff.
• With default mode and with binary off, writing, displaying
  \n, \r, and \r\n as well as wraping behaviour are as follow:

    writing:
    --------
    ff=unix   eol is written as \n
    ff=dos    eol is written as \r\n
    ff=mac    eol is written as \r

    vim always check

    displaying:
    -----------
    ff=unix: \n   is used as eol, and shown as the value of eol specified in lcs.
    ff=dos : \r\n is used as eol, and shown as the value of eol specified in lcs.
    ff=mac : \r   is used as eol, and shown as the value of eol specified in lcs.

    ff=unix: \r   shown as ^M.
    ff=mac : \n   shown as ^J.

    ff=dos : \r   shown as ^M.
    ff=dos : \n   shown as the value of eol specified in lcs.
    ff=dos : \r\n shown as the value of eol specified in lcs.
    ff=dos : \n\r {eol}^M

    line wraping at:
    ----------------
    ff=unix: \n
    ff=mac : \r
    ff=dos : \r\n and \n
