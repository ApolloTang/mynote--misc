--------
Formula
--------

A "formula" is a package definition written in Ruby [1].

-------
Cellar
-------

Formulae are installed in the "Cellar" [2].

  /usr/local/Cellar/

Example:

  /usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/5.2.2
  /usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch@1.7/1.7.6_1

-------------
non-keg-only
-------------

A "non-keg-only" formulae are linked into place such as "/usr/local/bin"
or "/usr/local/lib" with "brew link" [3]. For example

  /usr/local/bin/elasticsearch -> ../Cellar/elasticsearch/5.2.2/bin/elasticsearch

You can also see this by running [4][5]:

  $ brew link node --dry-run
  Would link:
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/npm
  /usr/local/bin/node
  /usr/local/include/node
  /usr/local/share/doc/node
  /usr/local/share/man/man1/node.1
  /usr/local/share/systemtap/tapset/node

By default "/usr/local/bin" is in your PATH and you should set it up
so that it is search before before "/usr/bin" [6].

---------
keg-only
---------

A "keg-only" fomulae does not linked into "Homebrew prefix" [8]
That means other software that depends on it has to specify a
full path to "/usr/local/Cellar" [3].

-----------------
/usr/local/opt
-----------------

Alternative, rather then pointing a dependency path to "/usr/local/Cellar"
you can point to the dependency in "/usr/local/opt/" [9] because all
formulae install in Cellar are opt-linked [2]. Examples:

  /usr/local/opt/elasticsearch -> ../Cellar/elasticsearch/5.2.2
  /usr/local/opt/elasticsearch@1.7 -> ../Cellar/elasticsearch@1.7/1.7.6_1
