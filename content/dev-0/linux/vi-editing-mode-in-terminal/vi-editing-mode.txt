Vi mode in Bash
================

To use vi mode in Bash and any other tool that uses GNU Readline,
such as the MySQL command line, you need only put this into your
.inputrc file, then log out and in again:

  set editing-mode vi

If you only want to use this mode in Bash, an alternative is to
 use the following in your .bashrc, again with a login/logout
 or resourcing of the file:

  set -o vi

You can check this has applied correctly with the following, which
 will spit out a list of the currently available bindings for
 a set of fixed possible actions for text:

  bind -P
