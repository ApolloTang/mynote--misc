my yarn is installed via brew:

yarn's executable is located in

  $ ll `which yarn`
  ....   31B 13 Feb  2021 /usr/local/bin/yarn -> ../Cellar/yarn/1.22.10/bin/yarn

or

  $ ll /usr/local/Cellar/yarn/1.22.10/bin/yarn
  -r-xr-xr-x  1 <user>  admin   132B 13 Feb  2021 /usr/local/Cellar/yarn/1.22.10/bin/yarn

The content of this exec is:

  $ cat yarn
  #!/bin/bash
  PREFIX="/usr/local" NPM_CONFIG_PYTHON="/usr/bin/python" exec "/usr/local/Cellar/yarn/1.22.10/libexec/bin/yarn.js"  "$@"

Which node version is yarn dedended on?

  $ cat /usr/local/Cellar/yarn/1.22.10/libexec/package.json  | rg node
      "node": ">=4.0.0"
