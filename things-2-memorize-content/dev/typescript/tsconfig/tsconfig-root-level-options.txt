About path syntax
-----------------
If path are specified without "./" or "../" prefix, then it is
interpreted as local to "tsconfig.json" (meaning: it imply "./").

You can drop the .ts extension from the glob pattern and let the
TypeScript compiler search for the input files.

When a glob pattern doesnâ€™t have a file extension, TypeScript
looks for the files ending with .ts or .d.ts extension in the
directory pointed by the glob pattern.

[!] Watch out
if you use relative path you may end up place the output outside
your desire dist/ folder.




options
=======

files
------

Value is an array contains the location of the TypeScript files
to consider for the compilation.

"files" option required you to hand-pick individual files and
you can not use glob pattern.



include & exclude
-----------------

unlike "file" option, "include"/"exclude" option let you use glob
so you don't have to hand-pick individual files.

Using include and exclude together:
1st pass:
  you use include.
2nd pass:
  you remove the file you don't want to transpile with exclude.


The TypeScript compiler automatically excludes files from the
the following directories:

  "node_modules"
  "bower_components"
  "jspm_packages"
  "<outDir>"
