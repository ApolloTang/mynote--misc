tscconfig compilerOptions
Basic Options
==========================

module
------

This tell the compiler to generate code for the target environment.
For eg., if we want the code to run in nodejs (only support commonjs),
then we must specify "commonjs". If we specify ES2020 then it
won't be able to run on the targeted environment.

if value of "module" is not specified, it will be generated automatically
depend on value specified on "target".

  target=ES3,ES5  module->commonjs
  target=ES6      module->ES6

see:
  https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module
  https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html


allowJs
-------
Tells compiler to search for *.js files.
But what would happen if you set allowJs=false but import a *.js
file from a *.ts file?
Answer:
  the *.js file will not be imported.

The default value of allowJs is false.



outFile
-------
When set, compiler bundle output into one single js file.
The value is the file path to where you want the bundle to save.

[!]
This option cannot be used unless the "module" is set to:
  None, System, or AMD.
It can not be used when value of "module" is set to:
  CommonJS, ES6 or UMD



outDir
------

If "outDir" is not specified, "outDir" will take the value of "rootDir".


rootDir
-------

If "rootDir" is not specified, the compiler auto calculated as
longest common path that include all files to compile.
