dotenv-webpack plugin
========================================

How does it work?
-----------------
  Say you have a variable in your enviroment:

    MY_ENV_VARIABLE=foo

  In your code you want to read the content of
  MY_ENV_VARIABLE and assign to myEnvVariable or
  print it out with console.log:

    const myEnvVariable = process.env.MY_ENV_VARIABLE
    console.log(process.env.MY_ENV_VARIABLE)

  But the object 'process' does not exist in web-browser
  (because that object only exist in node). So to get around this
  'dotenv-webpack' plugin replace the token 'process.env.MY_ENV_VARIABLE'
  with its value during webpack bundling. If you look in to the
  bundle output, you will see the above code as:

    var myEnvVariable = 'foo'; console.log('foo')

  During production, uglyfied code will obfuscate your
  variable name:

    const mySecretKey = process.env.SECRET_KEY
    doSomethingWithSecret(process.env.SECRET)

  is bundle as:

    var a='xxxxxx'; f('xxxxxx');
