# How to install dependencies for development 

(with eg flask):

```
git clone https://github.com/pallets/flask
cd flask
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

Note the folder `venv` has been ignored in `.gitignore`:

```
(venv) $ grep 'venv' .gitignore
venv/
.venv/
```

Dependencies for the flask repo are specified in the fold called `./requirements`:

```
(venv) $ ls requirements
dev.in    docs.txt               tests-pallets-min.in   tests.txt
dev.txt   tests-pallets-dev.in   tests-pallets-min.txt  typing.in
docs.in   tests-pallets-dev.txt  tests.in               typing.txt
```

These files are generated by the command `pip compile`. 

The generated requirement files are organized according to their purpose. For example: `dev.*` are for development, `tests.*` are for testing, `docs.*` are generating document etc. 

Not sure what the `*.in` are for, but the `*.txt` is the files used for installation; the version of the dependencies are specified within. 

The following is is how you would install the dependencies in the virtual environment for development: 

```
(venv) $ python -m pip install -r ./requirements/dev.txt
```

To see what has been installed: 

```
(venv) $ python -m pip list
Package                       Version
----------------------------- -----------
alabaster                     0.7.12
asgiref                       3.5.2
...

```
