Summary:
  docker run --name playground -dit ubuntu
  docker attach playground
  to exit without stopping the container: ^P^Q

----
Get a ubuntu container running as a playground:

  docker run -dit ubuntu

After it, checked for the processes running using:

  docker ps -a

For attaching again the container

  docker attach CONTAINER_NAME


TIP:
  For exiting without stopping the container type: ^P^Q


NOTE:
  Interesting to note that there is no need to run "sh" command.
  that is because the image's final layer is 'CMD ["/bin/sh"]'.
  Although you still have to specified `-it` to put it
  into interactive mode. [1] Ubuntu is not the only destro
  config as such, you can do the same with:

    docker run -it ubuntu:latest   (188mb)
    docker run -it busybox:latest  (2mb)
    docker run -it debian:latest   (85mb)
