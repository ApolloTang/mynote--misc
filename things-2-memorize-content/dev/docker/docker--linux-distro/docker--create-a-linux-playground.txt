Summary:
--------

  docker run --name playground -dit debian
  docker attach playground
  to exit without stopping the container: ^P^Q

----
Download debian image; create and start a container from this
image:

  docker run -dit ubuntu

Meaning of flag:

  -d: detach, -i: interactive: -t:tty terminal

After it, checked for the processes running using:

  docker ps -a

The Container is running in background, attach it to foreground
so you can interact with the container:

  docker attach CONTAINER_NAME

TIP:
  For exiting without stopping the container type: ^P^Q


NOTE:
  Interesting to note that there is no need to run "sh" command.
  that is because the image's final layer is 'CMD ["/bin/sh"]'.
  Although you still have to specified `-it` to put it
  into interactive mode. [1] Ubuntu is not the only destro
  config as such, you can do the same with:

    docker run -it debian:latest  (85mb)
    docker run -it ubuntu:latest  (188mb)
    docker run -it alpine:latest  (5.6mb)
    docker run -it busybox:latest (2mb)
