All functions must return a value
==================================

Because all functions must return a value, it follows that
'if' statements must have an 'else' statement:

  > doubleSmallNumber x = if x > 100
                          then x
                          else x * 2



"'" is a valid character for function names
===========================================

  > conanO'Brien = "It's a-me, Conan O'Brien!"


• Once a function is declare, it name cannot be changed.
• The order of which a function is declare does not matter.
