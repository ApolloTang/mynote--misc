  h  – Human Readable. This tells it to display all the values
       in human readable form (instead of "112543662.08 bytes",
       it will show "107.33MB")

  a  – (required) This tells it to archive, it will preserve permissions,
       modified/created dates and any other extra data with the file.

  v  – verbose, list all file copied

  p  – Progress/Partial – This is actually 2 commands in one. Progress
       will show you the progress of each file as it transfers (so you
       can see that it's actually copying data). Partial will resume
       files that have been inturrupted part way through copying.

  n  - dry run

  Important Note:
    The excluded folder  is relative to the sourcefolder
    if souce is a folder it must end with slash: 'sourceFolder/'

  Useful example:
    copy a project  without copying .git/ and node_modules/ (dry-run):

    rsync -havpn ./proj/ ./projCopy --exclude node_modules --exclude .git
