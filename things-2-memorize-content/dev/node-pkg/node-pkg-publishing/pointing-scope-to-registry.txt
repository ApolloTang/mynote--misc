You can also map different scopes to different npm registries.
 For eg, to use the scope @company-scope from your npm Enterprise
 registry, while continuing to install public packages from the
 public npm registry


  npm login --scope=@company-scope --registry=https://registry.company-registry.npme.io/

  I haven't try this but I think it means every time you $npm adduser,
  with Username company-scope, it will set the registry for you ?
