There are three ways to install yarn on OSX:

  1. npm
  2. curl
  3. brew
  4. other

  currently I am using method 3 (brew) for my installation

---
1. Using npm:

  Using npm to install yarn as global npm package [1]:

    $ npm install -g yarn

    If you use this method, yarn will be attached your
    the version of node managed by nvm. Meaning:
    when you swich node version, you may have to install yarn again.


2. Using curl [2]:

  curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash

     I have not investigate where this script install the yarn binary.


3. Using Homebrew:

    $ brew install yarn

    This install yarn at location:

      /usr/local/Cellar/yarn/<version>/bin/yarn

    and is symlink to (available to PATH):

      /usr/local/bin/yarn

4. This article mention some weird way for installing
   yarn, and I am not sure if it is a good advice.
