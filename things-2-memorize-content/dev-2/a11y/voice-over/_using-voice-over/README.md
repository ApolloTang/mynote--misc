## How to configure VoiceOver

VoiceOver is configured via the *VoiceOver Utility* dialogue:

To access this dialogue, if VoiceOver is already activated and you know your VoiceOver modifier (`VO`), you can simply type:

```
VO-F8
```

Otherwise, you can access the VoiceOver Utility by navigation using: 

```
Apple menu > System setting > Accessibility > VoiceOver
```

or search "voiceover" in the `System Setting`.

This will open the VoiceOver dialogue.
