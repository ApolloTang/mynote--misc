```
var path = require( "path" );
console.log( path.join( __dirname, "does-not-exist.txt" ) );  

>>  /.../wf/sub/data.txt
```

```
console.log( require.resolve( "./does-not-exist.txt" ) );  

>> Error: Cannot find module './does-not-exist.txt'
```

Note that `require.resolve()` look at the Ô¨Åle system to
make sure the module exists.

Therefore you can not use `require.resolve()` on a file that never exist.
For example if you want to save a new file.
