Type of token to match:
-----------------------

 '-w' will match non word charactors:

   $ echo 'abc @# xyx' | grep -ow '@#'
   @#

 '\b' will not match non word charactors:

   $ echo 'abc @# xyx' | grep -o '\b@#\b'
   <no match>


How does '\b' work?
--------------------

  Consider the string:

    "I have 12, he has 2!"

  '\b' sees the above string like this:

    |I| |have| |12|, |he| |has| |2|!
       ^      ^     ^    ^     ^      spaces

  Where the '|' is the anchor position '\b'.
  Note that '!' does not have end of word boundary as it is not
  a word character.

  "\b..\b" will match:

    |I| |have| |12|, |he| |has| |2|!
    ^^^^^
    b. .b

    |I| |have| |12|, |he| |has| |2|!
               ^^^^
               b..b

    |I| |have| |12|, |he| |has| |2|!
                  ^^^^
                  b..b

    |I| |have| |12|, |he| |has| |2|!
                     ^^^^
                     b..b


    |I| |have| |12|, |he| |has| |2|!
                              ^^^^^
                              b. .b


    ----
    $ echo 'I have 12, he has 2!' | grep -o '\b..\b'
    I
    12
    ,
    he
     2
    # 1st and 3rd line have space as second character
