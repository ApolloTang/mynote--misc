Open result in vim

$ vim -q <(grep -Hn '<pattern>' *)


Useful commands for quickfix [1]:

  :copen " Open the quickfix window
  :ccl   " Close it
  :cw    " Open it if there are "errors", close it otherwise (some people prefer this)
  :cn    " Go to the next error in the window
  :cp    " Go to the previous error in the window
  :cnf   " Go to the first error in the next file
  :.cc   " Go to error under cursor (if cursor is in quickfix window)



Use unimpare [2]

  [q and ]q  " go forward and back in the quickfix list.
  [Q and ]Q  " go to the beginning and end (which is especially
               handy if you only have one item in the list; this makes vim complain about [q and ]q.
