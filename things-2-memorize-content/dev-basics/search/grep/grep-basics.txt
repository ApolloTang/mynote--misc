  grep -F '<string>' <filename>

  Because of the delimitor '\n', this printf prints 3 lines:

    $ printf 'avocado\nmango\nguava' | grep 'v'

  If your input ﬁle has some other format like \r\n (carriage
  return and newline characters) as line ending, convert the input
  ﬁle to Unix style before processing.

  How to check if a file is DOS formated ending:

    $ printf '42\r\n' > dos-ending.txt
    $ file dos-ending.txt
    dos-ending.txt: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
