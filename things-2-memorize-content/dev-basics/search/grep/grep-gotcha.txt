  • <pattern> is BRE by default, so make sure you use '-F'
    (fix string) flag if you are matching string literal.
  • Always quote the <pattern> with single quote to avoid shell
    expansion.

  Because of the delimitor '\n', this printf prints 3 lines:

    $ printf 'avocado\nmango\nguava' | grep 'v'
                     ^^     ^^

  Make sure the file to grep is not in DOS format (\r\n).
  Check DOS format with the "file" command:

    $ printf '42\r\n' > dos-ending.txt
    $ file dos-ending.txt
    dos-ending.txt: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators

  ---

  The following are opposite pairs (Capital case are negation):
    -l -L (print file name only)
    -h -H (include file name in result)

  With multiple input, count is displayed for each ﬁle separately.
  Use "cat" if you want to combined count. For eg:

    cat <(seq 15) <(seq 15) myfile.txt | grep -c -F '1' -
