In BRE the following the meta-characters lose their meaning.

  '?'  '+'    ## note that '*' is not in the list
  '{'         ## note that '}' is not in the list
  '(' ')'
  '|'

To use them as regex expression you need to escape them.

Also note the absense of other meta-char such as:

  '.' '[' ']'

Eg:

  % printf 'ab\na?' | grep -o 'a?.*'   ## this match '?' literally
  a?

  % printf 'ab\na?' | grep -o 'a\?.*'  ## the literal 'a' is optional
  ab
  a?
