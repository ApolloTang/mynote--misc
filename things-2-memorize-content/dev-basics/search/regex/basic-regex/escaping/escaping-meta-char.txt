To get BRE funtionality the following does not require escaping:

  line anchore:   ^ $


To get BRE funtionality the following require escaping:

  word boundary:  \b \B \< \>
  Alternator:     \|
            :     \? \+ \( \)
                  \{              ## note that '}' does not require escaping





In BRE the following meta-characters lose their special meaning:

  '?'  '+'    ## note that '*' is not in the list
  '{'         ## note that '}' is not in the list
  '(' ')'
  '|'

To use them as regex expression you need to escape them.

Note meta-char such the following preserve special meaning
(no need to escape):

  '.'
  '[' ']'
  '*'
  '}'
  (there could be more not listed here)


Eg:

  % printf 'ab\na?' | grep -o 'a?.*'   ## this match '?' literally
  a?

  % printf 'ab\na?' | grep -o 'a\?.*'  ## the literal 'a' is optional
  ab
  a?
