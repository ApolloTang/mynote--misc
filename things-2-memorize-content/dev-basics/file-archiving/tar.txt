    Note:
    ~~~~~

    - Extracting an archive overwrites any files with the same
      names in the current directory without warning

    - Unless you are operating as the superuser, files and directories
      extracted from archives take on the ownership of the user performing
      the restoration, rather than the original owner.

    - tar remove any leading slash from the pathname when creating
      the archive.

    - performance comparison see: [1]


    options
    ~~~~~~~

    -c
       Create an archive. Youâ€™ll have to list the input files and
       directories on the command line.

    -r
       Append files to an existing archive.

    -u
       Append new/changed files to an existing archive.

    -t
       List the archive.

    -x
       Extract files from the archive.

    -f file
       Read the archive from, or write the archive to, the given file.
       This is usually a TAR file on disk (such as myarchive.tar) but can also be a tape drive (such as /dev/st0).

    -z
       Use gzip compression.

    -j
       Use bzip2 compression.

    -Z
       Use Unix compression.

    -b N
       Use a block size of N * 512 bytes.

    -v
       Verbose mode: print extra information.

    -h
       Follow symbolic links rather than merely copying them.

    -p
       When extracting files, restore their original permissions and ownership.

    --exclude pattern
       Do not process files or directories that match the specified pat-
       tern.  Note that exclusions take precedence over patterns or
       filenames specified on the command line.
