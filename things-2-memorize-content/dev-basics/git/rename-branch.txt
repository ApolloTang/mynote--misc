Renaming a branch on local and remote
=====================================

  tl;dr;
  ------
  % git branch -m old_branch_name new_branch_name   ## Rename branch locally
  % git push --set-upstream origin new_branch_name  ## Push the new branch and track it on remote
  % git push origin :old_branch_name                ## Delete the old branch on remote


  longer version bellow:
  ----------------------

  ## Rename branch locally

    % git branch -m old_branch_name new_branch_name

  ## But the remote branch track by the branch with new name is still the old_branch_name

    % git branch -vv | grep new_branch_name
      * new_branch_name      1b265ab4 [origin/old_branch_name] <most recent commit message>

  ## Create a new branch on remote, and set it as the remote tracking branch

    % git push --set-upstream origin new_branch_name

  ## Verify that the branch track by the local branch is now the one with new name

    % git branch -vv | grep new_branch_name
      * new_branch_name      1b265ab4 [origin/new_branch_name] <most recent commit message>

  ## delete the old branch on remote

    % git push origin :old_branch_name
