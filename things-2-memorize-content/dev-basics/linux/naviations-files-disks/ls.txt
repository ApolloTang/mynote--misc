ls

-d

  Use this option in conjunction with the "-l" option to see
  details about the directory itself rather then its content.

  Normally, the command "ls -l dir" will list the content of "dir/".
  If you want to list the "dir/" itself use the "-d" flag. Eg:

    % tree -F
      .
      └── dir/
          ├── content--type-dir/
          │   └── content-in-dir--type-file.txt
          └── content--type-file.txt

    % ls -l dir
    total 0
    drwxr-xr-x  3 apollo.tang  staff  96 10 Apr 13:53 content--type-dir
    -rw-r--r--@ 1 apollo.tang  staff   0  1 Feb  2020 content--type-file.txt

    % ls -ld dir
    drwxr-xr-x  5 apollo.tang  staff  160 10 Apr 13:53 dir


========
Sorting
========

-t

    Sort result by modification timestamp

-S

    Sort result by file size.
    Note: This does not show the size of directory including its
          content. If that is what you want you have to use "du"
