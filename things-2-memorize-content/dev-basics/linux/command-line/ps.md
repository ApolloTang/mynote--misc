# Difference behaviors of the PS command between osx (ventura) and Fedora



## ps (no flag)

I tested on Fedora, the `ps` command by itself only show process status associate with the *current*  terminal session, In **osx Ventura** it shows processes associate include other terminals.  For example, if I have one iterm2 terminal running in osx, `ps` command will show:

```
$ ps
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
68923 ttys000    0:00.26 -bash
```

Now,  if I open another terminal, ps command it show:

```
$ ps
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
68923 ttys000    0:00.26 -bash
69284 ttys001    0:00.22 -bash
```

Note that in the above the `TTY` column contains `ttys000` and `ttys001`.  This is because on osx the `ps` command follows a BSD conventions. To have `ps` command by itself (no flag) behave almost similar to that in Fedora (which shows only the process associate to current terminal) you can use the `-T` flag [ref](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/300864/how-to-get-the-basic-linux-ps-functionality-in-mac): 

```
$ ps -T
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
68922 ttys000    0:00.03 /usr/bin/login -fpl john /Users/john/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/ShellLauncher --launch_shell
68923 ttys000    0:00.26 -bash
69723 ttys000    0:00.01 ps -T
```

Note that in the above the `TTY` column only contain `ttys000` (no `ttys001`). 

The man page for `ps` on osx said:

```
-T      Display information about processes attached to the device associated 
        with the standard input.
```

Which I assume the device mentioned is the terminal.

### ps x

According to the Fedora man page, the `x` flag in Fedora (without `-`) will show processes **owned by `you`** (not limit to that associated to the *current*  terminal session):

```
       x      Lift the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is imposed 
              upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without "-") options 
              are used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.  The
              set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the 
              set of processes selected by other means.  An alternate description 
              is that this option causes ps to list all processes **owned by you** (same
              EUID as ps), or to list all processes when used together with the a option.
```

The Fedora's man page does not say anything about this flag with dash (`-x` ); However, using the `x` flag with a dash still work, and the number line of processes listed are the same:

```
$ ps -x | wc -l
78
$ ps x | wc -l
78
```

The column generated by both `ps -x` or `ps x` in **Fidora** are the same: 

```
$ ps -x | head -n 1
    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
$ ps x | head -n 1
    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
```

In **osx Ventura**, the results return different number of process: 

```
$ ps -x | wc -l
     547

$ ps x | wc -l
     546
```

The column generated also different:

```
$ ps -x | head -n 1
  PID TTY           TIME CMD

$ ps x | head -n 1
  PID   TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND
```

The **osx Ventura** man page say nothing about `ps x`, but it does mention `ps -x`:  

```
  -x      When displaying processes matched by other options, include 
          processes which do not have a controlling terminal.  This is 
          the opposite of the -X option.  If both -X and -x are specified
          in the same command, then ps will use the one which was specified last.
```

Note that above does not say anything about *owning by you*. It says **include process which do not have a controlling terminal**
