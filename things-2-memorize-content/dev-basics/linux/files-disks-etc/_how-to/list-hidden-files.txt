Listing hidden file
```````````````````

  The command bellow will include ".."

    ls -d .*

  because the expansion of whildcard "*" will include "."
  to result in "..". We use "-d" so it will not list
  everything in the parent directory. #[1]

  If you want to exclude ".." use [2]:

    ls -d .[!.]*

  The above will not list filename and directory name start with
  multiple dot.

  If you want to include filename and directory name start with
  multiple dot (while still exclude ".."), use this [3]:

    ls -d .!(|.)
