Colon ":" is a do nothing operator.
A do nohting operator is also called 'no-op' (no operation).
With a no-op, The overall return code will be true (zero) even
if it did not succeed.


To illustrate:

cat > bad-command
#!/usr/bin/env bash
bad-command () {
  rm does_not_exist;
}
bad-command
^D


chmod 744 bad-command && ./$_; echo $?
rm: does_not_exist: No such file or directory
1
^--- exit code is one

Now, lets add a colon operator


cat > bad-command-no-op
#!/usr/bin/env bash
bad-command-no-op () {
  rm does_not_exist;:
  #                 ^---- no-op here
}
bad-command-no-op
^D

chmod 744 bad-command-no-op && ./$_; echo $?
0
^---- exit code is zero
