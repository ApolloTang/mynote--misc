Lexicographical order
=====================

  First the two list heads are compared, and if they’re equal, the
  second elements are compared. If the second elements are also
  equal, the third elements are compared, and so on, until differing
  elements are found. The order of the two lists is determined by
  the order of the ﬁrst pair of differing elements.

  Eg in Haskell:

    When evaluate [3,4,2] < [3,4,3], Haskell sees that 3 and 3 are
    equal, so it compares 4 and 4. Those two are also equal, so
    it compares 2 and 3. 2 is smaller than 3, so it comes to the
    conclusion that the ﬁrst list is smaller than the second one.
