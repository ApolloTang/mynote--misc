  • Never run brew as sudo:
      Not "sudo brew install" nor "sudo brew link".

  • Change /usr/local/* to be owned by $USER, not root:
      $ sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/*
    That way you can have write permissions and not need sudo.

  • Homebrew installs packages (Keg) to Cellar
      /usr/local/Cellar/
    and then symlinks the packages into
     /usr/local/

  • The $PATH entry for
      /usr/local/bin
    should occur before
      /usr/bin
