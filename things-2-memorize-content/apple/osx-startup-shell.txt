Different between login shell and interactive shell:

  Login shells:

    Shells that prompt the user for user credentials.
    eg: when you connect to a remote computer with ssh, the remote
        system will ask for user credentials.

  Interactive shells:

    Eg: When you open an interactive virtual terminal application,
        it does not prompt for credentials.

  The need for separation between login and interactive:

    Users would usually log in once, and then might create multiple
    interactive shells from that login session.
    You could have one-time 'expensive' configurations in the login
    session, and repeated less resource intensive configurations
    for the interactive sessions.

Meaning of Login and Interactive shell in OSX

  When user opens Terminal.app, there is no login session, it
  does not prompt user for user credentials. However, OSX treats
  every launching of a new terminal or terminal tab a login shell.

  Once you are in the terminal subshells (like running bash) OSX treats
  shells as interactive.

So for Bash the reading sequences are:

  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |                |Interactive|Interactive|Script|
  |                |login      |non-login  |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |/etc/profile    |   A       |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |/etc/bash.bashrc|           |    A      |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |~/.bashrc       |           |    B      |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |~/.bash_profile |   B1      |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |~/.bash_login   |   B2      |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |~/.profile      |   B3      |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |BASH_ENV        |           |           |  A   |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |                |           |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |                |           |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |~/.bash_logout  |    C      |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+

For Zsh the reading sequences are:

  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |                |Interactive|Interactive|Script|
  |                |login      |non-login  |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |/etc/zshenv     |    A      |    A      |  A   |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |~/.zshenv       |    B      |    B      |  B   |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |/etc/zprofile   |    C      |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |~/.zprofile     |    D      |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |/etc/zshrc      |    E      |    C      |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |~/.zshrc        |    F      |    D      |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |/etc/zlogin     |    G      |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |~/.zlogin       |    H      |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |                |           |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |                |           |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |~/.zlogout      |    I      |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+
  |/etc/zlogout    |    J      |           |      |
  +----------------+-----------+-----------+------+

To keep things simple, these are the setup you need:

  For bash, put customizations in ~/.bashrc, and make ~/.bash_profile
  source it.

â€ƒ For zsh, put customization in ~/.zshrc, which is always executed
  (there is no need for ~/.zprofile).
