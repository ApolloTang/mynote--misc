The NTSC video standard frame rate is 30 FPS. This is the standard
for videos produced in North America.  However, this standard
is based on creating a smooth representation of video motion captured
in the real world and may not be necessary for your project.

For example, if you specify 30 frames per second, the output will
be smooth, but the file will be about twice as large as a 15
fps video file. You may find that a 10 fps or 15 fps encoding
is very acceptable for your audience. Reducing the frame rate
can drastically reduce the size of the video file.
