Mnemonic
========

  >=4         read able,      b/c 3rd bit (read bit) must be 1, >100
  even-number non-executable, b/c 1st bit (exec bit) must be 0,  __0
  odd-number  executable,     b/c 1st bit (exec bit) must be 2,  --1

  example of using mnemonic
  -------------------------
  744 === u+x

  usr,grp,wrd
    7,  4,  4

  observations:
    every type are >=4
    only the usr type odd

  every type are >=4, (>=100) 3rd bit is set (readable)
  v   v   v
  111,100,100
  rwx,r--,r--
    ^
    only usr type 1st bit odd number
    thus only user is executable


To Remember:
============
  Group order is:
    user, group, world
    closer ---> futher

  Meaning of bit are:
    3st bit = read   4 = 100 is the minimum value to set this bit
    2nd bit = write  2 = 010 is the minimum value to set this bit
    1rd bit = exec   1 = 001 is the minimum value to set this bit

        rwx
    --------------------------------------
    7 = 111 = read(4) + write(2) + exec(1)
    6 = 110 = read(4) + write(2)
    5 = 101 = read(4)            + exec(1)
    4 = 100 = read(4)


0755
    user  (read, write, exe)
    group (read, exe)
    world (read, exe)

0744
    user  (read, write, exe)
    group (read)
    world (read)

0644
    user  (read, write)
    group (read)
    word  (read)

0444
    user  (read)
    group (read)
    world (read)

0555
    user  (read, exe)
    group (read, exe)
    world (read, exe)

if it is 4 digit the first digit "0" indicate the
number is written in octal format (Not sure about this)


Binary basic
------------

000 = 0
001 = 1
010 = 2
011 = 3
100 = 4
101 = 5
110 = 6
111 = 7
