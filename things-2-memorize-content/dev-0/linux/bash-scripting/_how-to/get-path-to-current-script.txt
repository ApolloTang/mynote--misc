The above snippet is from:

  https://electrictoolbox.com/bash-script-directory/

Note that it will not work if you source this file.
Only work if execute it directy (don't forget to chmod 744 <filename>).

Question:
  What the difference between this this command and "readlink"?
My guess answer:
  "readlink" will follow symbolic link but this will not.
