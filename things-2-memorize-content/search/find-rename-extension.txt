Use find to rename the extension of files recursively
=====================================================

Usage
-----

  rename ts(x?) file type to js(x?):

    find . -name '*.t*' -execdir rename 's/(.+)\.t(s.?)/$1.j$2/' '{}' \;





Explanation
-----------

This is summarised from [1]. Also see [4] for more similar rename method.

find /the/path -type f \
               -name '*.abc' \
               -execdir rename -n 's/(.+)\.abc$/version1_$1.abc/' '{}' \;

Main point:

  *  use -execdir instead of -exec:
      -execdir command is run from the subdirectory containing the matched
      file. so, instead of passing the whole path to rename, it only
      passes the matched filename.  this makes it much easier
      to write the regex. (see Note 3)

  * the backslash at the end of the -execdir line is required.
      it is there to escape the semicolon.
      that semicolun terminates the command run by -execdir.

  * the flag -n tell rename comand to do a dry run.



Explanation of the regex:

  * \.\/ match the leading ./ that -execdir passes in. Here the backslash
    is used to escape the . and / metacharacters.

  * (.+) match the filename. The parentheses capture the match for later use.

  * \.abc escape the dot, match the abc.

  * $ anchor the match at the end of the string.


Explanation of the replacement part:

  * version1_ add this text to every file name.

  * $1 references the existing filename, because we captured it
    with parentheses.
      If you use multiple sets of parentheses in the "match" part,
      you can refer to them here using $2, $3, etc.

  * .abc the new file name will end in .abc. No need to excape the
    dot metacharacter here in the "replace" section



Note:
========
(1) 'rename' is a perl command and it is no installed on OSX [2], to
    install use:

    brew install rename

(2) the substitude command is does not use vim regex, it is a perl regex
    [3]

(3) The original post said that `--execdir` pass in the leading
     `./` in filename, but did not. So the `\.\/` part in the
     regex is omitted.  May that is because I am on OSX not ubuntu.
