Replicate a file:

  • One ‘master’ document in the database and each replicant is
    a pointer to that document.
  • Change is reflected in every occurrence of the replicant.


Duplicate a file:

  • Edit one copy and every other copy remains unchanged.
  • Take up additional space in the database.
