Chrome saves a single backup of your bookmarks file as:

  "~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 3/Bookmarks.bak"

and it overwrites that backup each time you launch Chrome.


If you’ve accidentally deleted a bookmark.

  - Turn off internet.
  - Make duplicate of your profile
    "~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile\ 3"
  - close all open Chrome windows,
    but do not reopen Chrome. <--- ** VERY IMPORTANT **
    If you’ve already closed Chrome, leave it closed.
  - Your previous state of bookmark before your last lanch chrome
    is save in "Bookmarks.bak", make a copy of that before you
    reopen chrome.
  - Replace the current "Bookmarks" with "Bookmarks.bak" from
    the duplicate
  - Launch Chrome, and **YOU WILL SEE BOOKMARK** as the last time
    you close Chrome.
  - Drag the recovered bookmark or bookmark folder to another
    chrome profile.
  - Turn on internet, you will see the bookmarks sync to return
    you bookmark to the deleted state.
  - Drag and recovered bookmark or bookmark folder from the other
    chrome profile.
